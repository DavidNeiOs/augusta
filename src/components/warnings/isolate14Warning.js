      Since you don't have symptoms, you do not need testing for COVID-19 at
      this time. However, there’s a chance you could get sick since it’s less
      than 14 days since your exposure. You should self-monitor for any symptoms
      (fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat, or difficulty breathing). If you
      begin to develop these, you should take this self-assessment again.
